# CUTE USERS

We have now added a `user.txt` file. We can think of this as our first step into working with a database. 

You will need to start handling `/users/:id` routes (i.e. `req.url === /users/1`). 

You will need to read from the `user.txt` file and work parse it (think about turning it into object). Once you have parsed it, you can find the object that has the id === `:id` of the url.

You will need to have a html file to display their name and their avatar. You will need to think about how you might be able to dynamically add the user's data to your html? A simple way could be to replace some kind of placeholder?
